<br/>
This is my implementation of a Vaccine Monitor app created for the System Programming K24 course at the University of Athens.

### Create the input file:
    bash ./script_1/testFile.sh info/virusesFile.txt info/countriesFile.txt numLines duplicatesOn

Where **numLines** equals with the number of lines (records) that will be in the "inputFile.txt" and **duplicatesOn** = 1 if duplicate citizenIDs are allowed, or 0 if citizenIDs are unique.
